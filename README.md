SETUP:
Run `npm install`. This will install all the required dependencies.
Run `ng serve` to start the application (on port `http://localhost:4200/`).
Run `nodemon server.js`* to start the server (run in separate command window).

* - if it returns an error try installing nodemon with `npm install -g nodemon`
